# How to make a zettel entry

This is the body of the zettel (which means "slip").

* First bullet
* Second bullet

But, when I have an ordered or numbered list:

1. First
2. Second

```typescript
const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <h1>Hellowo</h1>
  )
}
```

What is I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***?

How about something that look like `code`/`monospace`?

And when I have a URL I want it to print also so I always write it out like this, like a regular URL:

https://monkeytype.com

* I put references at the bottom
